# Security

 Note that only the latest stable version is considered for security issues.

### Reporting a vulnerability

If you encounter a security vulnerability in Tinybox, please use the Security tab in this GitHub repo to privately disclose it.

 Please avoid using the main issue tracker to report any potentially critical security issues, as this will make the issue public, and thus expose it to potential bad actors.

 After reporting, a patch will be created ASAP, or if the issue is deemed non-critical (i.e. not a security issue) then a public bug issue will be opened.
