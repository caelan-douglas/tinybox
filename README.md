### Game vision
Tinybox *('tiny + sandbox')* is a sandbox-focused game that promotes creativity and experimentation. Some of the goals as of now are to add new building features that promote more interactions such as ropes or wires to connect things loosely, or buttons and switches that can connect to things and perform actions.

Additionally, an open way for players to create their own levels and gamemodes is part of the goal. Ideally, players will be given a powerful toolkit via the world editor that allows them to create complex levels, with some form of visual scripting to create unique features.

PvP is an integral part of Tinybox. In order to keep it aligned with the physics-based sandbox nature of the game, weapons generally interact with the world in some way (ex. bombs and rockets for ranged weapons, rather than hitscan weapons.)
